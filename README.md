# Kalman Filter Presentation

This is a presentation about Kalman filters for Computer Science Club. 


### Contents

There are some papers in the `/docs` folder, and some Jupyter notebooks mainly geared at 
demonstrating issues about conjugate priors and a Kalman filter example in the 
`/jupyter` folder.  There are also [presentation notes](docs/PresentationNotes.pdf) 
for the presentation.  



### Notebooks

The notes refer to the Jupyter notebooks, which provide reinforcement
of the concepts.  Care was taken that these be visible in the repo since GitHub
automatically launches a viewer for notebooks.  

Alternately, the project can be cloned or forked and these notebooks run.  One fun 
and appealing option is to run it on one of the new Amazon Machine Learning 
AMIs. [Here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/the-aws-deep-learning-ami-now-with-ubuntu/)
is a really nice tutorial from Amazon on setting one up and using an SSH tunnel to 
avoid messing with configuring Jupyter to be secure.  This gives you a lot of 
power very easily and cheaply while having the convenience of the familiar notebook
environment.
