# Kalman Filter Presentation

This is a presentation about Kalman filters for Computer Science Club.  There are 
some papers in the `/docs` folder, and some Jupyter notebooks mainly geared at 
demonstrating issues about conjugate priors and a Kalman filter example in the 
`/jupyter` folder.  There are also notes for the presentation in the root of 
the repo.  The notes refer to the Jupyter notebooks, which provide reinforcement
of the concepts.  Care was taken that these be visible in the repo since GitHub
automatically launches a viewer for notebooks.  Alternately, the project can
be cloned or forked and these notebooks run.
